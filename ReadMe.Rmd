## Overview
The run_analysis.R script file is used to generate a tiday data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  The needed data sets are created by merging training and the test sets generated by UCI's Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones project.


## dataset used:
=========================================

- Activity Label 
- Activity
- Features
- Measures
- Subject

## tidy data output
- subject_id
- activity
- average by subject and activity 


Joined three data frames (subject, activity, measure to create tidy dataset)
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
dflist <- list(as.data.frame(subject), as.data.frame(activity), as.data.frame(measure))
tidydata <- join_all(dflist)

```
